/***********************************************************
Data:
We generated data either by having arbitrary edges between vertices, or by having fixed number of
neighbors for every vertex in the graph.
All data files follow the following format:
For plots where the performance is to be compared with increase in
number of vertices, keeping everything else constant, use these:
 
file_<number_of_vertices>_<number_of_neighbors_per_vertex>.txt

Example: file_10_10.txt will have 10 vertices and each vertex will 
have 10 neighbors (this is a clique the size of the graph)

For running the code on arbitrary graphs, with no control on number
or size of cliques, use these:

random_<number_of_vertices>.txt

Example: random_1000.txt consists of a graph with 1000 vertices.
